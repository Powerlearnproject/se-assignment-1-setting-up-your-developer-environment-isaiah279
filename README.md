# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).

- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.
#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.
#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.


Setup Documentation
Operating System Installation:

though i know how to install many OS, i have tried 
I chose Windows 11 as my operating system, which I downloaded and installed from the official Microsoft website. The installation process was straightforward, and I followed the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

IDE Installation:
I opted for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) due to its versatility and extensive plugin support. I downloaded and installed VS Code from the official website.

Version Control System:
I installed Git on my local machine and created a GitHub account to host my repositories. I initialized a Git repository for my project and made my first commit. This involved creating a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.

Programming Languages and Runtimes:
I installed Python from the official website. This included downloading the installer and following the setup instructions. To verify the installation, I ran python --version in the command prompt.

Package Managers:
I installed pip, the package manager for Python, which was included with the Python installation. I verified its installation by running pip --version.

Database Configuration:
I downloaded and installed MySQL from the official MySQL website. I followed the installation wizard and configured MySQL with a root password. I also set up a sample database to ensure the installation was successful.

Development Environments and Virtualization:
Although optional, I explored Docker as a virtualization tool to isolate project dependencies. I installed Docker Desktop for Windows and created a simple Docker container to run a Python application.

Extensions and Plugins:
To enhance VS Code's functionality, I installed several extensions, including Python (for syntax highlighting and debugging), GitLens (for version control integration), and Prettier (for code formatting).

GitHub Repository
I created a GitHub repository for a sample Python project, which includes the following:

A .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files.
An initial commit with a basic Python script.
Documentation files such as README.md outlining the project and setup instructions.
The repository can be accessed at [GitHub Repository Link].

Reflection on Challenges
During the setup process, I faced several challenges:

Python Path Configuration: Initially, the Python installation was not recognized in the command prompt. I resolved this by adding Python to the system PATH environment variable.
MySQL Configuration: Setting up the root password and configuring the database was challenging. I referred to the official documentation and community forums for guidance.
Docker Setup: Running Docker on Windows required enabling the WSL 2 feature and ensuring virtualization was enabled in the BIOS settings. This required a few system reboots and configuration changes.
To overcome these challenges, I relied on online resources, documentation, and community support forums. Taking a systematic approach and documenting each step helped me track my progress and troubleshoot issues effectively.

By completing this assignment, I have established a robust and efficient developer environment tailored to my project needs, ensuring a productive workflow for future development tasks.
